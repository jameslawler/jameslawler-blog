<p>I bought my domain jameslawler.com in April 2010 in order to &quot;own&quot; my presence on the Internet. I believe that a lot of people think that having a domain is only for a website, but I use it for a lot more than that.</p>
<h2>Email</h2>
<p>I used to have a gmail account, but once I bought my domain, I setup all email to now go through my domain. Underneath I still used gmail to be the Inbox client (using the old, no longer available Google Workspace), but from the outside someone would send an email to my domain instead.</p>
<p>This provides me with a <strong>major</strong> benefit of email server portability. At some point I decided to minimise my usage of Google products from fear of being locked out of my account and losing all my email and contacts. I moved to a paid email service, so that I could feel comfortable being the customer and not being the product.</p>
<p>The classic saying still holds up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The move was really easy and I was up and running in the new email server with all of my old emails transfered over in only a few minutes. From the outside no one noticed as my email address did not change.</p>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>Having a web presence can be important for building an online portfolio, or just have a way for people to contact you and keep up to date with what you are working on. Of course you could just use a social media service, but you don't really own that presence as you could lose you account at any time, or the service could shut down.</p>
<p>By running a simple website on my domain, I have full control of what content I want to show. Running a website can be done for free by using plenty of free services out there like GitHub Pages (if you are technical enough).</p>
<p>My current website runs on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> and you can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/jameslawler/jameslawler-blog">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Sub domains</h2>
<p>A nice benefit of having a domain is that you have unlimited sub domains that you can configure. For example I could create https://linkedin.jameslawler.com and set it up to redirect to my profile.</p>
