## üëã About Me

My name is James Lawler and I am a full stack software developer. I currently focus on the JavaScript tech stack and micro service architecture. This is my personal website which I use to keep track of things I have done over time and write down my [notes](https://notes.jameslawler.com) on various topics. It is easy to lose track of what you have learnt and accomplished, and this site will be a record of my time as a developer.
