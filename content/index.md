## üëã About Me

</div>

My name is James Lawler and I am a full stack software developer. I currently focus on the JavaScript tech stack and micro-service architecture. This is my personal website which I use to keep track of things I have done over time and write down my [notes](/notes) on various topics. It is easy to lose track of what you have learnt and accomplished, and this site will be a record of my time as a developer.
