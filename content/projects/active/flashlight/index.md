The [Flashlight](https://flashlight.jameslawler.com/) project is a simple single page application that displays a single colour and allow swiping the screen up or down to increase and decrease the brightness.

## Why build this?

Smartphones typically have a built in flashlight that uses the camera's flash, but this light is extremely bright and will wake up anyone in the same room if it is late a night. I found myself opening a webpage like Google, just to have a white screen and this would be plenty of light to see.

I built this simple website to do exactly that, be a white page, and give me some control over the brightness by swiping on the screen.
