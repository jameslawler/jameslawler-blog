In this example project it contains a simple routing structure of providing a <code>api</code> and <code>web</code> routes. The routes return either partial HTML or full pages.</p>\n<h2>HTMX</h2>\n<p>As part of this new project I wanted to integrate HTMX to see how it differs from using a full SPA library like React. HTMX simplifies the project by removing the need to minify / bundle the project with tools like Vite.</p>\n<p>In this example project, the <code>package.json</code> only has three dependecies.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-json\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"dependencies\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">\"hono\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"^4.11.2\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"htmx.org\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"^2.0.8\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token property\">\"devDependencies\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"wrangler\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"^4.54.0\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>`</code></pre>\n<p>Currently the <code>htmx.min.js</code> is copied manually from the <code>node_modules</code> folder into the <code>public</code> folder and then referenced in the top level HTML file.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>The next step in my new project is to add <a href=\"https://www.better-auth.com/\">better-auth</a> authentication so I can create features that are public and private. The authentication framework will use the Cloudflare D1 resource to store user and session information. At first I will keep it simple and just use email/password authentication without any kind of email verification. I will intentially disable new account sign up until the project is ready and use it for myself to protect AI features.</p>\n", "date_published": "2025-12-26T00:00:00Z" }

Users will be able to see a high level view of the language learning process for the various levels (A1, A2, etc) and open more specific information and links for each topic.</p>\n<p>Rather than focusing on providing links to resources, the content provided on the site will guide the user through that unit.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloudflare Workers - server side APIs</li>\n<li>Cloudflare D1 - server side database</li>\n<li>Hono - server side framework</li>\n<li>better-auth - authentication framework</li>\n<li>HTMX - client side code</li>\n<li>Cloudflare AI - LLM resources</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tools Hono, better-auth, and HTMX are new to me and will have a learning curve to integrate them.</p>\n<p>The technology list above is not fixed, and if any of them become too complicated to integrate, I may switch to a different set of technologies.</p>\n<h2>Plan</h2>\n<p>I will work through this project in various stages to tackle each problem one at a time. Below is an initial list of the topics that will need to be solved.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create the initial project and connect it to Cloudflare with a D1 database.</li>\n<li>Create a simple home page in HTMX.</li>\n<li>Add authentication (email/password) with a signup and login page.</li>\n<li>Add a basic node map for the first few steps of learning Portuguese.</li>\n<li>Add a overlay when a node is clicked and load the data in HTMX from the server side.</li>\n<li>Add AI integrations to the learning overlay.</li>\n<li>Create a first full node map with content.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Costs</h2>\n<p>The project will run in Cloudflare which provides a decent free tier for workers, D1 database, and AI. If I am the only one using this project, then I imagine the costs will fall within the free tier. If I see a potential for opening up the project to the public in the future, I would need to determine some pricing to make sure it covers the overhead costs of Cloudflare.</p>\n<h2>AI</h2>\n<p>Cloudflare provides many open source models, including the GPT open source models for text generation. I would like to make use of those AI models and once a simple text chat is working, I will experiment with the speech to text, and text to speech models. My end goal would be to see if it is possible to have a &quot;professor&quot; experience interacting with the content on the web page, so I can just talk to my browser and have it talk back.</p>\n", "date_published": "2025-12-24T00:00:00Z" }

I did a <a href=\"https://www.jameslawler.com/projects/meal-planner/\">write up</a> of the project and how I published it into the Cloudflare Developer Platform.</p>\n<p>Overall I had a very positive experience because of the way Cloudflare integrates with GitHub. Rather than needed to setup GitHub actions to build and deploy the project, this is all handled on the Cloudflare side. I connected the project into Cloudflare by giving access to that specific respository. On any pushes to the <code>main</code> or other branches it triggers a build process and can even handle versioned environments if I want to keep <code>main</code> only for production, and <code>feature</code> branches for internal usage.</p>\n<p>Each project could be connected to a different domain / sub domain and from the Cloudflare platform I have a nice overview of each project. This was much more difficuly before when I was running everything in a VPS under a docker host. Now I can have a quick overview of all logs, metrics, request durations, etc with minimal maintenance from my side. I can just focus on the project ideas and less on the infrastructure management.</p>\n<p>Compared to other cloud providers, with Cloudflare, I did not need to provide any payment details as long as I stay within their free tier limits. For small hobby projects like mine, this is not a problem, and even with a small user base I still don't think I would reach their limits.</p>\n", "date_published": "2025-06-20T00:00:00Z" }

Most recently I was using Ghost as platform for managing my blog posts and using GitHub as the website host. I wrote a few <a href=\"https://www.jameslawler.com/tags/ghost\">blog posts</a> about the process.</p>\n<p>The Ghost platform was a nice simple web interface to work with and it could run completely in Docker, so it didn't need to mess up my host machine. However over time it became more of a burden for my simple website.</p>\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\n<p>As I was running Ghost locally in a Docker container, I encountered the following issues;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I frequently had problems logging in and had to remotely connect into the MySQL instance of Ghost within the Docker image to fix the credentials.</li>\n<li>I felt like I couldn't do much cutomization to the content of the pages / posts.</li>\n<li>I prefer the clean structure of a Markdown text file over a proprietry format provided by Ghost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I wanted</h2>\n<p>For a while It was perfectly fine using Ghost, but as the issues above because more frequent I found myself reluctant to want to make updates to my website. What I really wanted was something that could do the following;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be a static website that I can host in many places for free without server maintenance</li>\n<li>Work with Markdown files</li>\n<li>Work with Frontmatter format in markdown files so I can have simple template data defined and render it to the page</li>\n<li>Support templating</li>\n<li>Work with <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">TailwindCSS</a> for design implementation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I changed to</h2>\n<p>In the past I have used <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">11ty</a> and found it to be a good solution to all of those issues above, and so I decided to switch my blog over to a simple 11ty blog structure.</p>\n<p>By defualt 11ty provides everything on the list, except for TailwindCSS support.</p>\n<h2>Adding TailwindCSS</h2>\n<p>To add TailwindCSS support, I followed a <a href=\"https://dev.to/psypher1/lets-learn-11ty-part-7-adding-tailwind-5cdh\">simple guide</a> I found and then completely stripped out any existing css files from the 11ty project to be sure everything was TailwindCSS driven for the front end design.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>At the moment I am really happy with the <a href=\"https://github.com/jameslawler/jameslawler-blog\">outcome</a>. I have a very simple repository in GitHub that stores all of my content in markdown files. I only needed to create a few simple templates for generating the HTML files.</p>\n<p>Any time I make an update to the repostiory, it automatically builds in GitHub Actions and publishes the updates to the GitHub Pages.</p>\n<p>Overall the maintenance is light-weight and my content is fully portable if I want to move to another system in the future.</p>\n", "date_published": "2024-10-09T00:00:00Z" }

In that post I described using a public GitHub repository to host both the Ghost content folder and the generated static website. In this post I will show how to keep the Ghost content folder in a private repository and only host the generated static website in a public repository.</p>\n<h2>What you need</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A public repository in GitHub that will hold the generated static website</li>\n<li>A private repository in GitHub that will hold your content folder and GitHub workflow</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Public Repository</h2>\n<p>Simply create a new repository in GitHub. You don't need to commit or push anything to it. This will happen automatically. The only thing you need to do is go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages on the <strong>gh-pages</strong> branch.</p>\n<h2>Private Repository</h2>\n<p>Create a private repository in GitHub and setup your Ghost blog by following the guide from my previous post. The different is in the GitHub workflow file. Here you need to configure the <strong>Deploy to GitHub Pages</strong> step to deploy to a different repository within your account.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Deploy to GitHub Pages\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> JamesIves/github<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>pages<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>deploy<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>action@4.1.7\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">with</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">branch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> gh<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>pages\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">folder</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> static\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">token</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> $\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">repository-name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> jameslawler/jameslawler<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>website</code></pre>\n<p>By default, your GitHub workflow won't have permission to manipulate another repository. In order to do this, you need to <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token\">create a Personal Access Token</a>. The token should have at least the <strong>public_repo</strong> permission.</p>\n<p>Once you have the token you need to make it available to your GitHub workflow. Since this repository is private, you could just put it straight in the source code. But for better security practices, I would use a <strong>secret</strong> which can be <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository\">configured at the repository</a> and then is passed to the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow\">GitHub workflow inside a secret context</a>.</p>\n<h2>Testing it out</h2>\n<p>Once you have the public and private repositories setup, and you have the GitHub workflow modifications to connect the two repositories together, it is time to test it out. Trigger the GitHub workflow on the private repository. This will build the Ghost static site, and then push it to the <strong>gh-pages</strong> branch of the public repository. Within a few minutes, the blog will be available on your GitHub pages url.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I set this up with a two repository approach myself because I wanted to keep the Ghost content folder and database secret. The content folder contains upcoming posts, theme code, and also anyone can connect to the database file directly and look inside the tables. This way, the only public potion is the generated static files which the user will be able to see anyway when browsing the blog.</p>\n", "date_published": "2021-12-17T00:00:00Z" }

It is important to note that the cron schedule uses UTC time and so you will need to adjust it if you want it to match your local time. To have more granular post times, you would need to increase the frequency of the cron schedule.</p>\n<h2>Perfect Streak</h2>\n<p>The only &quot;negative&quot; with this approach is that it automatically makes daily commits to one of your repositories and it makes your GitHub contributions graph look not so honest.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://www.jameslawler.com/img/ngCV2yWaAY-1334.avif 1334w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.jameslawler.com/img/ngCV2yWaAY-1334.webp 1334w\"><img alt=\"GitHub streak graph\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.jameslawler.com/img/ngCV2yWaAY-1334.png\" width=\"1334\" height=\"325\"></picture></p>\n<p>You can see that from December onwards is when I enabled the daily GitHub Action to build and deploy my static Ghost blog. But apart from that, the solution is simple and works.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Using GitHub Actions with a cron schedule allows scheduled Ghost posts to go live within an acceptable timeframe of the publish date. I would say this is fine for a personal blog with infrequent posts. In the future I want to find a way to not publish to GitHub Pages if there were no updates. Perhaps checking if any new urls have been generated since the last time.</p>\n", "date_published": "2021-12-11T00:00:00Z" }

Depending on the domain registry they will have different interfaces to change the settings.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\">        A record for @ pointing to 185.199.108.153\n        A record for @ pointing to 185.199.109.153\n        A record for @ pointing to 185.199.110.153\n        A record for @ pointing to 185.199.111.153\n        <span class=\"token key atrule\">CNAME record for www pointing to your username.github.io (the username should be replaced with your actual GitHub account username)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span></code></pre>\n<p>A lot of registrars have pages showing how to setup GitHub Pages on your domain.

When it is up and running, check to make sure all the links work on your page, so you can confirm the <strong>gssg</strong> generation worked successfully.</p>\n", "date_published": "2021-12-04T00:00:00Z" }

To start this project you need to be running the Ghost Docker container on your development computer. This means you need to have Docker installed locally - and there is a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\">handy guide</a> on the Docker website for the main operating systems.</p>\n<p>Before starting up the Ghost Docker container you will need a directory where you can store the Ghost content (static assets, SQL database, etc). For this post I setup a <a href=\"https://github.com/jameslawlercom/2021-11-27-ghost-blog-on-github-pages-using-github-actions\">new repository</a> in GitHub to store the content so it would stay under version control.</p>\n<p>To start the Ghost Docker container on your local machine, open a console and navigate to the directory you have setup with a GitHub repository and execute the following command.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>docker run -d -p 2368:2368 -v content:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost:alpine</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This command will run up the latest version of Ghost using the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost\">alpine Docker image</a>. It will run on the standard <strong>2368</strong> port and mount the current <strong>content</strong> directory into the Docker container at <strong>/var/lib/ghost/content</strong>. This means that any changes to the Ghost instance (new posts, theme, etc) will be exposed to the current working folder and can be committed to GitHub.</p>\n<p>After running the command, you should be able to access the locally running version of Ghost at <strong>http:// localhost:2368/</strong>. At first you will need to setup an account (only saved in your local database), and then you will be able to add new pages, posts, and change the navigation settings etc. You will also be able to configure the theme for your website.</p>\n<h2>GitHub Workflow</h2>\n<p>Once there is a locally running instance of Ghost, the next step is to get it running in GitHub Pages. The key to do this is using GitHub Actions with the help of a GitHub workflow. To setup a GitHub workflow you need to add a <strong>.github\\workflows</strong> folder. Each GitHub workflow is just a <strong>yaml</strong> file within this directory.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Deploy Ghost and Generate Static Site\n\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">on</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">branches</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>main<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">jobs</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">build</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">runs-on</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> ubuntu<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>latest\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">steps</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Check out Model Repository\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">actions/checkout@v2 - name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Run Ghost\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">run</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">docker run -d -p 2368:2368 -v $/content:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost:alpine - name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Sleep for 10 seconds\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> jakejarvis/wait<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>action@master\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">with</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">time</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> \"10s\" <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Install ghost<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>static<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>site<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>generator\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">run</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">npm install -g ghost-static-site-generator - name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Generate Static Site\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">run</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">gssg --url https://jameslawlercom.github.io --subDir 2021-11-27-ghost-blog-on-github-pages-using-github-actions - name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Deploy to Github Pages\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> JamesIves/github<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>pages<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>deploy<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>action@4.1.7\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">with</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">branch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> gh<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>pages\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">folder</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> static</code></pre>\n<p>In the first section, the trigger is configured.
